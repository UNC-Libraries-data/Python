### Week 2

We'll return to the [Introductory Materials](Intro/Introduction_CrashCourse.html#Review:-Data-Types) to review fundamental concepts, packages, file paths, and a few important extensions, then we'll work through an example using data on COVID-19.

### Python Exercises 
**[Exercises](Intro/Exercises.html)**<br/>
**[Solutions](Intro/Exercises_Solutions.html)**


## Intro to Data

### Week 1

We'll introduce a format for literate programming: [Jupyter Notebooks](Jupyter/Jupyter-Notebooks.html).  Then, we'll get started with [Pandas](Jupyter/Pandas.html) for Data in Python.

### Week 2

We'll continue with [Pandas](Jupyter/Pandas.html) and explore some visualization tools by applying them to some simple research questions about a dataset.

### Week 3

We'll cover [some topics in Pandas and base Python](Jupyter/Extra_Topics.html), then explore some [other useful packages](Jupyter/Other-Packages.html).
