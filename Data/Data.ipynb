    "## Literate Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Literate programming combines computer code with natural language to document and explain the code. This idea expands on the way we've used comments and pseudocode to organize and document our code directly in a .py file. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Science:** Literate programming allows you to share code with descriptions and context to make interpretation and adaptation easier.  Code outputs might include tables, summaries of analyses, and data visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Open / Reproducible / Replicable Science:** Embed code in an article format allows others to examine and re-use specific code for reproduction or replication alongside traditional prose explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Education:** This workshop series was created with literate programming via Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [**Examples in Jupyter Notebooks**](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation for our series of Python workshops are an application of literate programming using a tool called Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks save as **.ipynb** files (Jupyter Notebooks were previously called IPython Notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Lab provides an interface for Jupyter that will eventually replace the classic Jupyter Notebook interface some of you may have encountered before.  You can launch it by opening the Prompt/Terminal:\n",
    "* (PC) Start Menu > Miniforge3 > Miniforge Prompt\n",
    "* (Mac) Finder > Applications > Utilities > Terminal  \n",
    "\n",
    "And typing: `jupyter lab`.  Note that the older interface is available by typing `jupyter notebook` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Jupyter Lab opens in your browser, you can use the Launcher tab or **File Menu>New>Notebook** to create a Jupyter Notebook in a tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work with Jupyter Lab for the remainder of the workshop!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Resources:\n",
    "### [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Binder is a free, non-profit, online service that hosts fully functional Jupyter Notebooks.  You can view this workbook at:\n",
    "https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UNC-Libraries-data/Python/main?filepath=Data/Data\n",

    "## Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Jupyter Notebook is made up of individual cells of different types: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Markdown** for formatted text\n",
    "* **Code** for Python  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each type of cell needs to be \"Run\" to display formatted text or evaluate Python code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Command and Edit Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Edit Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Double click or click and press enter on a cell to enter Edit Mode on a Markdown Cell.  Click once for Python cells.  This allows you to change the code or markdown within.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Command Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Click to the left of the cell, or hit Esc in a cell already in Edit mode to enter Command Mode.  This allows you to add, copy and paste, or rearrange cells, or change the mode of a cell with keyboard shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding and Deleting Cells\n",
    "\n",
    " Click the + button at the top left to add cells (below) or use these shortcuts to insert cells from **Command Mode**:\n",
    " * `a` (insert cell above)\n",
    " * `b` (insert cell below) \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside each cell, use the dropdown menu on the toolbar to choose between \"Markdown\" and \"Code\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Right click a cell and choose \"Delete cell\" or press the D key *twice* in Command mode to remove a cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is a convenient shorthand way to write HTML.  A full introduction to the syntax is available [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "A few of the most important pieces of syntax are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `` # ## ### `` ... represent ... level 1, 2, 3 headers respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "* `` *text* ``  ... displays as ... *text*\n",

Polars is also able to efficiently run parallel processes, adding to its improved performance. "

    "\n",
    "As you move into more complicated processes in Python (or applying code to a wide variety of objects or files), processing time can become a major factor.  Fortunately, most modern laptops have multiple processor cores that can do separate things at the same time.  Python only uses **one core** by default.  If you have a set of loops that don't depend on each other (e.g. processing lots of files one after another), you could split up your many loop iterations between processors to greatly increase speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`joblib` package](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides a straightforward way to split loops up between your computers cores for faster performance on complicated code.  Note that parallelization may not benefit you much or may even hurt you for very quick jobs because setting up and consolidating information from separate cores creates overhead costs. \n"
