# Python Crash Courses: Intro to Data
*[UNC University Library](https://library.unc.edu/data/)*  
*[UNC Research Computing](https://its.unc.edu/research-computing/)*

## [Setup](../Setup)

Installing the Anaconda Distribution.
If you run into problems during installation, please come **30 minutes early** to the first session for help.

### Week 1

We'll introduce a format for literate programming: [Jupyter Notebooks](Jupyter/Jupyter-Notebooks.html).  Then, we'll get started with [Pandas](Jupyter/Pandas.html) for Data in Python.

### Week 2

We'll continue with [Pandas](Jupyter/Pandas.html) and explore some visualization tools by applying them to some simple research questions about a dataset.

### Week 3

We'll cover [some topics in Pandas and base Python](Jupyter/Extra_Topics.html), then explore some [other useful packages](Jupyter/Other-Packages.html).
