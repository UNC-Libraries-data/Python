    "## Literate Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Literate programming combines computer code with natural language to document and explain the code. This idea expands on the way we've used comments and pseudocode to organize and document our code directly in a .py file. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Science:** Literate programming allows you to share code with descriptions and context to make interpretation and adaptation easier.  Code outputs might include tables, summaries of analyses, and data visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Open / Reproducible / Replicable Science:** Embed code in an article format allows others to examine and re-use specific code for reproduction or replication alongside traditional prose explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Education:** This workshop series was created with literate programming via Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation for our series of Python workshops are an application of literate programming using a tool called Jupyter Notebooks.  If you installed Anaconda, you already have Jupyter Notebooks available:\n",
    "\n",
    "(PC) Start Menu > Anaconda3 (64-bit) > Jupyter Notebook  \n",
    "(Mac) Finder > Applications > Anaconda Navigator > Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Note**: If you installed miniconda, you may not have Jupyter installed yet.  To install:  \n",
    "    + (PC) Start Menu > Anaconda3 > Anaconda Prompt  \n",
    "    + (Mac) Finder > Applications > Utilities > Terminal  \n",
    "\n",
    "    + In the console window, run the following line (choose yes when prompted):\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to navigate through the directories displayed (as in Finder(Mac) or Windows Explorer(PC)) to find existing files, or control where a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new Jupyter Notebook, click the New button at the top right of the screen and choose Notebook:Python 3.\n",

    "### [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Binder is a free, non-profit, online service that hosts fully functional Jupyter Notebooks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Jupyter Notebook is made up of individual cells of different types: \"Markdown\" for formatted text, and \"Code\" for Python.  Each type of cell needs to be \"Run\" for its output to appear properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a cell (as appropriate):  \n",
    "Insert > Cell Above  \n",
    "Insert > Cell Below  \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside each cell, use the dropdown menu on the toolbar to choose between \"Markdown\" and \"Code\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is a convenient shorthand way to write html.  A full introduction to the syntax is available [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# \\## \\### ... represent ... level 1, 2, 3 headers respectively\n",
    "\n",
