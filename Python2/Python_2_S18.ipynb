    "As you get started coding in Python, there will be many many tasks and steps you aren't familiar with!

Learning to write and use pseudocode where appropriate can help organize your plan for any individual script.\n",

    "Pseudocode is essentially a first draft of your code, written in English for **human consumption**, though with the tools of your programming language in mind.  For example, we might write pseudocode for extracting text from pdf files as:\n",

    "1. Set Working Directory\n",
    "2. Loop through each pdf in the directory:\n",
    "    * open the pdf file\n",

    "    * check length of text extracted\n",

    "3. Write output file(s)\n",
