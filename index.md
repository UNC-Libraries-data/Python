View our [introductory orientation to Python and Spyder (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKjLHg85BJo) **before Week 1**.

## Week 1

We'll be quickly introducing fundamental Python concepts like variables, object types, and indexing, alongside a simple dataset example.

The concepts are covered in more depth in our full-length [Introductory Materials](Intro/Introduction.html), if you'd like to review beforehand.
