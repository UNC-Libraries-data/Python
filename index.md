# Python Crash Courses
*[University Libraries at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://library.unc.edu/data/)*  
*[UNC Research Computing](https://its.unc.edu/research-computing/)*

## [Setup](Setup.html)

Installing the Anaconda Distribution.

If you run into problems during installation, please come **30 minutes early** to the first session for help.

View our [introductory orientation to Python and Spyder (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKjLHg85BJo) **before Week 1**.

## [Week 1](Intro/Introduction_CrashCourse.html)

We'll be quickly introducing fundamental Python concepts like variables, object types, and indexing.

The concepts are covered in more depth in our full-length [Introductory Materials](Intro/Introduction.html), if you'd like to review beforehand.

## Week 2

We'll return to the [Introductory Materials](Intro/Introduction_CrashCourse.html#Pseudocode-and-Comments) to review fundamental concepts, packages, file paths, and a few important extensions, then we'll work through an example using data on COVID-19.

## Practice Exercises (Introduction)
**[Exercises](Intro/Exercises.html)**<br/>
**[Solutions](Intro/Exercises_Solutions.html)**

## Week 3-5: Data in Python

* Jupyter Notebooks
* File paths and Packages
* Pandas
* Visualization
* Survey of other useful data packages


<!---
## Week 3

We'll review [Jupyter Notebooks and literate programming](Jupyter/Jupyter-Notebooks.html), then move along to the basics of [working with packages and file paths in Python](Files_Packages/Files_Packages.html).  Finally we'll introduce one of Python's foundational data manipulation packages, [Pandas](Jupyter/Pandas.html).

## [Week 4](Jupyter/Pandas.html)

We'll continue working with Pandas, dealing with a real dataset, and extending into other packages for data visualization.

## [Files and Packages](Files_Packages/Files_Packages.html)

Installing and importing python packages and modules.  Working with file paths to read and write files from Python.

## [Jupyter Notebooks](Jupyter/Jupyter-Notebooks.html)

Jupyter Notebooks implement "literate programming", blending plain English in Markdown/HTML with Python code for better documentation.

## [Pandas](Jupyter/Pandas.html)
* [Pandas (without Table of Contents)](Jupyter/Pandas-nocontents.html)

The `pandas` package provides a wide array of tools for working with tabular datasets in Python.  This lesson also surveys some of the major data visualization tools available in Python.

**[Exercises](Jupyter/PandasExercises.html)**<br/>
**[Solutions](Jupyter/PandasSolutions.html)**

## [Other Packages](Jupyter/Other-Packages.html)

A quick survey of other Python packages for webscraping, APIs, mathematical and statistical functionality, text analysis, and more.
