# Python Crash Courses
*[University Libraries at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://library.unc.edu/data/)*  
*[UNC Research Computing](https://its.unc.edu/research-computing/)*

## [Setup](Setup.html)

Installing the Anaconda Distribution.

If you run into problems during installation, please come **30 minutes early** to the first session for help.

## [Session 1](Session1/Session1_CrashCourse.html)
We'll introduce fundamental Python concepts like variables, object types, and indexing.

## [Session 2](Session2/Session2_CrashCourse.html)
We'll work with more complex concepts like exception handling and user-defined functions. Then, we'll explore some third party packages.
