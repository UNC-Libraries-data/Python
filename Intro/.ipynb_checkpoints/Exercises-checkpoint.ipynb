    "      * Hint: The `.split()` function can be used to split a string into a list of words. For example: `str = \"I want pizza.\"` Using the following code, you can split the sentence `str` into a list of words separated by spaces: `list = str.split(\" \")`. This command uses whitespaces `(\" \")` to separate words into a list, leading to the following output: `[\"I\", \"want\", \"pizza.\"]`. You can now use list indexing to easily access words within a sentence. For example, `list[2]` would output the word `\"pizza.\"`\n",
    "      * Hint Hint: Use the `.join()` function to join elements of a list into a string. Let's use our earlier example, where `list=[\"I\", \"want\", \"pizza.\"]`. Here, the command `\" \".join(list)` glues all of the elements in `list` together with whitespaces (`\" \"`) between them. As a result, using the command `str = \" \".join(list)` will bring us back to where we started! `str = \"I want pizza.\"`\n",
