    "If you use macOS or Linux, then you most likely already have Python on your computer!  Python does not come with Windows, but it may be on your machine as part of other software (e.g. ArcGIS Desktop).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, unless you've worked with Python already, your pre-existing installation may only include the bare minimum and may be an out of date version.  Therefore, we recommend installing a distribution, with Python and many useful add-ons already setup, for all operating systems.\n",

    "## Anaconda distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda packages the current version of Python 2 or 3 with over 150 packages included in the installation and supports hundreds of others.  This includes many of the most heavily used packages supporting data transformation and analysis, and software to manage and add new packages, create virtual environments, and more.\n",

If you don't have sufficient space, you can download [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), which is less than 100 MB.  Miniconda includes Python and the same package manager systems as Anaconda, but does not come packaged with *any* additional packages.  You'll need to install them one by one as needed.
