    "\n",
    "If you use macOS or Linux, then you most likely already have Python on your computer!  Python does not come with Windows, but it may be on your machine if you have certain software installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why not work with an existing installation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you've worked with Python already, your pre-existing installation may only include the bare minimum and may be an out of date version.  Therefore, we recommend installing a distribution, with Python and many useful add-ons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anaconda distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda packages the current version of Python 2 or 3 with over 150 packages included in the installation and hundreds of other supported.  This includes many of the most heavily used packages supporting data transformation and analysis, and software to manage and add new packages.\n",

Python 3 was released in 2008, and as of 2017 nearly all important tools had been re-written or updated for Python 3.  Python 2 will no longer be supported after 2020.
