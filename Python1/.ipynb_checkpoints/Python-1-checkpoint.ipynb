    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general-purpose programming language that has become popular for data and text analysis.  Python can be easier to learn than other languages because it emphasizes (human) readability and flexibility.  Python is [the third most used language on GitHub](https://octoverse.github.com/projects#languages); this means you'll find packages (sets of functionality developed by other users) to use Python for a wide variety of problems and tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't worked with a programming language before, learning Python will introduce you to approaches and thought processes common to many similar languages, making it easier to learn other languages like Java and R.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scripting: \n",
    "Writing code to automate repeptitive tasks.  For example, extracting text from thousands of pdf files and sorting them into directories based on the whether the texts mention particular people or places.  To do this, we'll need to create instructions for how to find the pdfs (and skip any non-pdfs!), open them, somehow extract text, search for a key term, then depending on what we find, move the file to a location.   In this series, we'll learn about some of the fundamental building blocks for translating a manual process into instructions the computer can understand.  The other uses outlined below often involve some element of automation!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quantitative analysis:\n",
    "Python has a well-developed ecosystem of specialized tools and functions for everything from fitting deep learning models with `tensorflow` to creating interactive visualizations with `bokeh`.  Most of this functionality isn't in base Python (our focus for Python 1), but we'll need base Python to bring together different packages and processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Natural Language Processing:\n",
    "The `NLTK` package, among others, provides tools for dealing with unstructured text like parsing words and sentences, or tagging parts of speech.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Others:\n",
    "Web development (`Django`), Image processing (`pillow`), Web scraping (`BeautifulSoup`), APIs, databases, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are few things you can do in Python that can't also be done elsewhere!  If you already know one or more programming language, you'll have to decide where Python best fits or helps in your own workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=red>Warning!</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're already comfortable with basic programming concepts, you'll probably find this workshop very straightforward.  The later workshops in the sequence may be more helpful if you're already familiar with the concepts below and just need to learn new syntax.  Experienced attendees are more than welcome to stay, review, and help other attendees!\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Python 2 vs Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Python 2 and Python 3 are widely used in research.  Unfortunately, while both Python 2 and 3 are very similar, there are a few key syntax differences. Python 3 was released in 2008; nearly all important tools have been re-written or updated for Python 3.  **Python 2 will not be maintained after January 1, 2020.**  This workshop will focus on Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)\n",
    "\n",
    "An IDE is software that groups together the many tools to ease development in a programming language, such as a code editor, compiler, and debugger in a convenient interface. There are many different IDEs to choose from.  IDEs are not necessary, but often good for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you gain experience, you can choose whether an IDE is right for your uses and which one works best for you. For the purposes of this workshop, we will use Spyder, which comes packaged with Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open Spyder:\n",
    "* **Windows**: Start>Anaconda3 64-bit>Spyder\n",
    "* **Mac**: Applications>Anaconda Navigator>Spyder\n",
    "\n",
    "![SpyderIDE.png](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries-data/Python/raw/master/Python1/images/SpyderIDE.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Spyder's default interface provides three panes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Editor pane (left) is a scripting window for writing Python code.\n",
    "* The Console pane (bottom right) contains a console for executing code.\n",
    "* The Explorer pane (top right) contains other helpful tools listing defined variables, files in the working directory, and other help."
